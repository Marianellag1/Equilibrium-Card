## Overview
A little Frontend Mentor practice challenge. I want to get more comfortable with html and css, and make my way up to more challenging challenges. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [live site URL](https://marianellag1.github.io/Equilibrium-Card/)


### Built with

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For Framework


### What I learned

I learned way more than I thought I would. It took a couple of hours to get to what I am showing, but I am extremely proud and happy of what I accomplished. It was a good challenge and I feel as if I am a little more confortable with css, obviously with the help of bootstrap that made the work a lot easier, and especially the tips frontend gave to make this challenge successful.

### Continued development

Although this challenge is only based on HTML and CSS, it still needs work. I still need to make an active element on image of card, as well as making it more rounded. 
I feel that although media query was given, the card showed as if it responded well when shrunken and expanded, but it doesn't hurt to add for a 'just in case' scenerio.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp) - This helped me tremendously. I found myself looking for the most basic things in W3Schools,
but the examples just help so much.
- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - Google is the best.
